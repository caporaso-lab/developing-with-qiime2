# Developing with QIIME 2

Your guide for writing, testing, and distributing QIIME 2 plugins, interfaces, and documentation.

```{note}
As of 13 March 2024, most of the content from the [old QIIME 2 Developer Documentation](https://dev.qiime2.org) has been transitioned to *Developing with QIIME 2*. 
This book will be moving over to https://dev.qiime2.org shortly. 

*Developing with QIIME 2* remains in very active development between March and April of 2024.
It should be getting more complete by the day. ðŸš€
```

```{note}
If you need help developing with QIIME 2, please feel free to reach out through the {{ developer_discussion }}.
This is preferred over contacting developers directly as there are many developers monitoring the forum (so you get help quicker!), and others can learn from our answers to your questions (so we can spend more time developing cool new functionality for QIIME 2!).

**We commit to responding to requests for help on the QIIME 2 Forum, but direct emails, posts on issues trackers, etc may not get responses.**

## Contents
This book is split into multiple parts covering topics in QIIME 2 development including [plugin development](plugin-intro), [interface development](interface-intro), and [documentation development](documentation-intro).
You do not need to master all of these sections to develop with QIIME 2.
For example, if you are interested in creating plugins, then the only section you need to concern yourself with is the [plugin development](plugin-intro) section.
Other topics, such as [framework development](framework-intro) and [distribution development](ci-intro), are advanced topics that are primarily targeted for the development team in the [Caporaso Lab](https://cap-lab.bio).
