# Contributing to the QIIME 2 developer documentation

At the moment, while we're still laying the groundwork, we're not accepting content contributions to *Developing with QIIME 2*.
If you have suggestions or feedback though, we'd love to hear them: please feel free to post to [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/developing-with-qiime2/issues).
