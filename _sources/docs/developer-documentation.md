# Contributing to *Developing with QIIME 2*

*Developing with QIIME 2* is a book being authored by [Greg Caporaso](https://github.com/gregcaporaso) and [Evan Bolyen](https://github.com/ebolyen). 
At the moment, while we're still laying the groundwork, we're not accepting content contributions.
If you have suggestions or feedback though, we'd love to hear them: please feel free to post to [the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/developing-with-qiime2/issues).

Ultimately, we expect to begin accepting contributions from others. 
When we get to that point, we will acknowledge any contributions in an *Acknowledgements* section of *Developing with QIIME 2*.
