## Citing QIIME 2 and its dependencies

QIIME 2 plugins frequently utilize other software packages that must be cited in addition to QIIME 2 itself.
QIIME 2 provides *citation reports* to help you ensure that you cite all relevant software.
Citation reports can be generated either by:
  * running `qiime tools citations` on an Artifact or Visualization, or
  * listing citations with [QIIME 2 View][q2view].
    To view the list of citations for a QIIME 2 Artifact or Visualization, load your result at [QIIME 2 View][q2view] and then navigate to the "Details" tab.

QIIME 2 itself should be cited with the linked citation {cite}`qiime2-2019`. The easiest way to access that citation is by generating one of the citation reports mentioned above.
