# Add a Pipeline with parallel computing support

In this chapter we'll add a second {term}`Pipeline` to our plugin, and then we'll add parallel computing support to that `Pipeline`.
This will enable your users to utilize multi-processor computers or multi-node high performance computing infrastructure (e.g., computer clusters) to analyze their data.

:class: note

The text for this chapter is not yet written, but the code has been added to q2-dwq2 in two commits.

The first commit ({{ dwq2_add_parallel_pipeline_commit_1_url }}) adds a new `Pipeline` to our plugin, and the second commit ({{ dwq2_add_parallel_pipeline_commit_2_url }}) adds parallel support to that `Pipeline`.

The write-up for this section of the tutorial is in progress, as of 10 July 2024, and is coming soon.
