# Developing with QIIME 2

Your guide for writing, testing, and distributing QIIME 2 plugins, interfaces, and documentation.

```{note}
*Developing with QIIME 2* remains in very active development between March and April of 2024.
It should be getting more complete by the day. ðŸš€

As of 13 March 2024, most of the content from the [old QIIME 2 Developer Documentation](https://dev.qiime2.org) has been transitioned to *Developing with QIIME 2*.
This book will be moving over to https://dev.qiime2.org shortly.

The [](plugin-tutorial-intro) section is where the focus is at the moment, and it'll stay there for the near future, though all of the [](plugins/intro.md) sections have useful and up-to-date content in them.
You'll also find content in [](framework-explanations) and various other sections throughout, but those are currently less thorough and generally need some updates.
Please [let us know](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/developing-with-qiime2/issues) if you find anything that is inaccurate or outdated.

The content in this book is organized under the [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework {cite}`diataxis`.

## Contents
This book is split into multiple parts covering topics in QIIME 2 development including [plugin development](plugin-intro), [interface development](interface-intro), and [documentation development](documentation-intro).
You do not need to master all of these sections to develop with QIIME 2.
For example, if you are interested in creating plugins, then the only section you need to concern yourself with is the [plugin development](plugin-intro) section.
Other topics, such as [framework development](framework-intro) and [distribution development](ci-intro), are advanced topics that are primarily targeted for the development team in the [Caporaso Lab](https://cap-lab.bio).
