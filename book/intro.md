# Developing with QIIME 2

*Developing with QIIME 2* is designed to help you write plugins, interfaces, and contribute to the QIIME 2 framework.

```{note}
We are currently (January 2024) transitioning content from the [old QIIME 2 Developer Documentation](https://dev.qiime2.org) to *Developing with QIIME 2*.
For as long as this note is here, there may be content there that is not covered here, so it may be worth referring to both documents.
Our goal is for this transition phase to be over fairly quickly.
```

```{note}
If you need help developing with QIIME 2, please feel free to reach out through the {{ developer_discussion }}.
This is preferred over contacting developers directly as there are many developers monitoring the forum (so you get help quicker!), and others can learn from our answers to your questions (so we can spend more time developing cool new functionality for QIIME 2!).

**We commit to responding to requests for help on the QIIME 2 Forum, but direct emails, posts on issues trackers, etc may be closed without reply.**
```

## Contents
This book is split into multiple parts covering topics in QIIME 2 development including [plugin development](plugin-intro), [interface development](interface-intro), and [documentation development](documentation-intro).
You do not need to master all of these sections to develop with QIIME 2.
For example, if you are interested in creating plugins, then the only section you need to concern yourself with is the [plugin development](plugin-intro) section.
Other topics, such as [framework development](framework-intro) and [distribution development](ci-intro), are advanced topics that are primarily targeted for the development team in the [Caporaso Lab](https://cap-lab.bio).
