# Archive versions
The structure of QIIME 2 {term}`archives<Archive>` has evolved as QIIME 2 has been developed.
This section describes each historical version of the QIIME 2 Archive format, and may be useful to interface developers whose code depends on guarantees made by that format ([source code](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/qiime2/core/archive/)).


## Version-agnostic format guarantees

Though there is significant variability in the format of QIIME 2 Archives across archive versions, all archive versions share some common traits.

These shared characteristics, defined in the `_Archive` class in [`qiime2/core/archive/archiver.py`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/qiime2/core/archive/archiver.py), must be consistent across all formats over time as they allow archive versions to be checked, and archives with different formats to be dispatched to the appropriate version-specific parsers.

All QIIME 2 Archives have:
- a directory named with the Archive UUID, directly under the archive root at `/<UUID>/`, and
- a file `/<UUID>/VERSION` within that directory, formatted as shown below.

{numref}`format-agnostic-archive-structure` illustrates the Archive file system.

The VERSION file format is described [above](archive-version-file). 

(archive-version-0)=
## Archive Version 0

Version 0 was the original QIIME 2 Archive format, and there aren't many V0 Archives "in the wild".
V0 Archives were produced by alpha versions of the QIIME 2 framework, and were superseded in framework version 2.0.6 on 24 October 2016.

- {term}`Result` data files are written in the directory `/<UUID>/data`
- Result UUID, Semantic Type, and Format information are saved in `/<UUID>/metadata.yaml`.
- The `ArchiveFormat` class in [`v0.py`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/qiime2/core/archive/format/v0.py) offers convenience methods for loading and parsing `metadata.yaml` files.

{numref}`v0-archive-format` illustrates the format of a Version 0 Archive.

(archive-version-1)=
## Archive Version 1

Released in QIIME 2 [version 2.0.6](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/releases/tag/2.0.6), [commit `bdc8aed`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/commit/bdc8aed08a7ce323a0f9901c6ff634680e58c7f3), Version 1 Archives introduce decentralized provenance tracking to QIIME 2.
[ArchiveFormat V1](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/blob/master/qiime2/core/archive/format/v1.py) inherits all traits of v0, modifying its `__init__()` and `write()` methods only to add provenance capture.

```{note}
All `ArchiveFormat` versions subclass their predecessor.
For example, the `ArchiveFormat` in `v1.py` inherits from the `ArchiveFormat` in `v0.py`, etc.
This makes it easier for humans to interpret the version history.
```

Provenance data is stored in the directory `/<UUID>/provenance/`.
Specifically, `metadata.yaml`, `action.yaml` and `VERSION` files are captured for the current Result and each of its ancestors.
Each Result's `action.yaml` file and associated data artifacts (e.g. sample metadata) are stored in an `action` directory alongside that Result's `VERSION` and `metadata.yaml`.
Considered together, we can describe these as "provenance files".
This structure is illustrated in {numref}`v1-archive-provenance-format`.

```{figure} ../images/v1-archive-provenance-format.svg
:name: v1-archive-provenance-format

Box and arrow diagram of the provenance files in a v1 archive.
The blue "multiple files" icon represents all provenance files associated with a single action (e.g. the current action, or one of its ancestors).
```

The structure of V1 Archives as a whole is illustrated in {numref}`v1-v4-archive-format`.

```{figure} ../images/v1-v4-archive-format.svg
:name: v1-v4-archive-format
Box and arrow diagram of a v1 archive.

Provenance files for the current Result are stored in `/<UUID>/provenance/`.
Provenance files for each ancestor Result are stored in directory at `/<root_UUID>/provenance/artifacts/<ancestor_UUID>/`.
```

```{note}
V0 Archives do not capture provenance data. As a result, if a V0 artifact is an ancestor to a V1 (or greater) artifact, it is possible for the `action.yaml` to list Artifact UUIDs which are not present in the `artifacts` directory.
```

(archive-version-2)=
## Archive Version 2
Released across QIIME 2 versions [2017.9](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/releases/tag/2017.9.0) ([changelog](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/qiime-2-2017-9-release-is-now-live/1160)) and [2017.10](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/releases/tag/2017.10.0) ([changelog](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/qiime-2-2017-10-release-is-now-live/1626)), the directory structure of this format is identical to v1, but the `action.yaml` file has changed.

In [commit `4389a0b`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/commit/4389a0b4ec41151144188ea230c8c56c1940c368) the Version 2 `ArchiveFormat` adds an `output-name` key to the `action` section of `action.yaml` (unless the action type is `import`), assigning it the output name registered to the relevant action.
Prior to this change, if one action returned multiple artifacts of the same {term}`Semantic Type`, it was not possible to differentiate between them using provenance alone.

In [commit `e072706`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/commit/e07270659bd4089afdeef744868f8b7ac9c698a9), it adds provenance support for {term}`Pipelines <Pipeline>`, adding the `alias-of` key to the `action` section of `action.yaml`.

(archive-version-3)=
## Archive Version 3
Released in QIIME 2 version [2017.12](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/releases/tag/2017.12.0) ([changelog](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/qiime-2-2017-12-release-is-now-live/2308)), [commit `684b8b7`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/commit/684b8b77276bd8fc7228042c674a166669bb5bef), the directory structure of this format is identical to v1 and v2.

With this release, QIIME 2 Actions are able to take variadic arguments, allowing users to pass collections of Artifacts (`List`s and `Set`s).
A YAML representer has been added so that `action.yaml` can represent `Set`s of Artifact inputs.
These will show up in `action.yaml` as custom `!set` tags.

(archive-version-4)=
## Archive Version 4
Released in QIIME 2 version [2018.4](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/releases/tag/2018.4.0) ([changelog](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/qiime-2-2018-4-release-is-now-live/3946)), [commit `00a294c`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/commit/00a294cbfc8737c1a2f57d695615098dc9beb4ad), this format adds citations to the directory format, adds a `transformers` section to `action.yaml`, and aligns the structure of `environment:framework` (also in `action.yaml`) to match the structure of `environment::plugins::<some_plugin>`.

Whenever an `Action` is run, its registered citations are captured.
When saved, they are written to a `citations.bib` file inside the Archive's `provenance` directory.
Citations for all of the current Result's ancestors are stored in their respective <UUID> directories (e.g. `/<root_UUID>/provenance/artifacts/<ancestor_UUID>/citations.bib`).

```{figure} ../images/v4-archive-provenance-format.svg
:name: v4-archive-provenance-format
Box and arrow diagram of the provenance files in a v4 archive.
```

The overall directory structure remains identical to a v1 archive ({numref}`v1-archive-provenance-format`).

Result-specific citation tags are also written to the `transformers` and `environment` sections of the `action.yaml` files, for the current Result and for all ancestors with registered citations.
A new custom `!cite '<citation key>'` tag is use to support this in YAML.

A `transformers` section is added between the `action` and `environment` sections of `action.yaml`.
Because Pipelines do not use transformers, transformers will be recorded only for {term}`Methods <Method>`, {term}`Visualizers <Visualizer>`, and when importing data (such as with `qiime tools import`).
It looks like the following:

```yaml
transformers:
inputs:
    demultiplexed_seqs:
    -   from: SingleLanePerSamplePairedEndFastqDirFmt
        to: SingleLanePerSamplePairedEndFastqDirFmt
output:
-   from: q2_types.feature_data._transformer:DNAIterator
    to: DNASequencesDirectoryFormat
    plugin: !ref 'environment:plugins:types'
```

`environment::framework` was previously only a version string, and is now structured identically to each plugin action's `software_entry`, with version, website, and citation sections:

```yaml
framework:
    version: 2019.10.0
    website: https://qiime2.org
    citations:
    - !cite 'framework|qiime2:2019.10.0|0'
plugins:
    fragment-insertion:
        version: 2019.10.0
        website: https://github.com/qiime2/q2-fragment-insertion
        citations:
        - !cite 'plugin|fragment-insertion:2019.10.0|0'
        ...
```

## Archive Version 5
Released in QIIME 2 version [2018.11](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/releases/tag/2018.11.0) ([changelog](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/qiime-2-2018-11-release-is-now-live/6879)) [commit `f95f324`](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/commit/f95f3246517e8c79bdab6b000d23f801030485e2), this format version adds archive checksums to the directory structure.

A new, md5sum-formatted checksum file has been added at `/<root_UUID>/checksums.md5`, with one md5sum and one filename on each line. For a more detailed specification, see the
[QIIME 2 Pull Request #414](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/pull/414).

`checksums.md` looks like the following:
