# User documentation

We recently transitioned from a single source of documentation (previously at `https://docs.qiime2.org`) to multiple sources of documentation: documentation covering distributions; documentation of stand-alone plugins; documentation of the QIIME 2 Framework; and dataset-focused documentations.
You can find more information about this in [this post on the QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/the-qiime-2-library-stacks/33325).
You can discover examples of each in the [QIIME 2 Library "Stacks"](https://library.qiime2.org/docs).

Most of our new documentation is being built using [Jupyter Book 2](https://next.jupyterbook.org) and our [usage example API](usage-example-api).
We're currently (as of 1 July 2025) building [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io) templates to help plugin developers and tutorial authors build and publish their own documentation.
In the meantime, you can refer to our most recent documentation projects, such as the [gut-to-soil microbiome axis tutorial](https://gut-to-soil-tutorial.readthedocs.io/) and the [q2-fmt documentation](https://q2-fmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for examples of how to build your own docs.
If you need help, reach out through the {{ developer_discussion }}.
