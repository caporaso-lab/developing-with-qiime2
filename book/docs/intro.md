# Docs Development

The *Docs Development* Part of *Developing with QIIME 2* isn't really written yet, but you will find relevant and up-to-date (as of 2 July 2025) information here if you're interested in writing documentation for developers or users of QIIME 2.

Most of our documentation is being built using [Jupyter Book 2](https://next.jupyterbook.org)[^jb1-dwq2] and our [usage example API](usage-example-api).

## Resources for documentarians

If you're about to jump into a documentation project, we recommend reading about {{ diataxis }}.
This approach has guided our restructuring of the QIIME 2 documentation, and (we think!) that it's helping us move toward clearer documentation than we've ever had for the project.

If you like writing documentation, you may be interested in the [Write the Docs community](https://www.writethedocs.org/).
They have collected many relevant resources and provide mechanisms for connecting with other documentation authors.

[^jb1-dwq2]: *Developing with QIIME 2* is the notable exception to this as [we haven't yet](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/developing-with-qiime2/issues/149) transitioned it from Jupyter Book 1.
