# Docs Development

The *Docs Development* Part of *Developing with QIIME 2* isn't really written yet, but you will find relevant and up-to-date (as of 2 July 2025) information here if you're interested in writing documentation for developers or users of QIIME 2.

## Resources for documentarians

If you're about to jump into a documentation project, we recommend reading about {{ diataxis }}.
This approach has guided our restructuring of the QIIME 2 documentation, and (we think!) that it's helping us move toward clearer documentation than we've ever had for the project.

And if you like writing documentation, you may be interested in the [Write the Docs community](https://www.writethedocs.org/).
They have collected many relevant resources and provide mechanisms for connecting with other documentation authors.
