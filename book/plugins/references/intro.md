You can find the up-to-date but soon-to-be-refactored QIIME 2 framework API documentation [here](https://dev.qiime2.org/latest/api-reference/). (If you're looking to use QIIME 2, rather than develop with QIIME 2, and you ended up on this page, you're most likely looking for the [QIIME 2 Python 3 (i.e., Artifact) API](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/interfaces/artifact-api/).)
