# Getting Started

:::{note}
This tutorial will follow the development of a QIIME 2 plugin from start to finish.
We will assume you have a development environment which includes:
a source code editor,
a command line terminal,
and a directory browser or file-tree.
If you do not have an existing environment
(or if you have only worked inside of notebooks),
then please read [](../developing-code.md) first.
