# Distribution Development

You don't need approval from existing QIIME 2 developers or maintainers to create and distribute your own tools, such as plugins, that build on QIIME 2.
This is the beauty of the plugin-based architecture of QIIME 2: development of tools for introducing novel functionality can be distributed by anyone, removing the lead development team as a bottleneck or gatekeeper between developers of new functionality and users interested in that functionality, and customized QIIME 2 distributions can be created and shared by users.
We encourage you to build your own tools if you would like to introduce new functionality into the QIIME 2 ecosystem, or alter the functionality of existing plugins or interfaces.
[Developing with QIIME 2](https://develop.qiime2.org/) is the primary resource for learning how to build and share your QIIME 2-based tools, and we are happy to support developers in the [Developer Discussion on the QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/dev-discussion).

As of this writing (23 April 2024) we are redesigning our approach to supporting sharing of QIIME 2 tools (see [](ci-how-to-publicize)).
As our support for this improves, this part ([](ci-intro)) of *Developing with QIIME 2* is where you'll find information to help you get started.
