# Publicize your QIIME 2 tools

```{note}
If you have suggestions on additional ways to publicize QIIME 2 plugins, we're interested!
Please [feel free to reach out](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/developing-with-qiime2/issues).
```

## QIIME 2 Library
We are currently (23 April 2024) working on a simplified set of tools for sharing your plugins with the QIIME 2 community, and this will ultimately replace the [QIIME 2 Library](https://library.qiime2.org).
Our end goal is to help you provide users with information such as the compatibility of your plugins with the current {term}`distributions <Distribution>`, where to find documentation and technical support, how to cite your plugin, and more.
We expect incremental progress on this over the next year.

## Community Contributions on the QIIME 2 Forum

When you create a new QIIME 2-based tool and are ready to share it with the QIIME 2 community, we recommend posting a new topic in the [Community Contributions category on the QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/community-contributions/15).
This is a way to share information on your tool, including what it is and how people can start using it.
For example, you could include information on the project's website, a brief tutorial, and how users should request technical support.

## Post a pre-print

Pre-prints are a citable way to get software announcement articles out while peer review is in process.
As you probably know, peer review can take *ages* and software moves quickly, so we find that it's worth it to publish software announcement pre-prints.
However, software annoucement papers are unfortunately not accepted by many pre-print servers.
Here are some exceptions to that, based on our experiences.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a pre-print server that does [seem to](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11198) accept software announcement pre-prints (e.g, see their [Quantitiative Biology](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio) category).

F1000 is another option that [we've had luck with](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-657).
It's not technically a pre-print server, but a peer-review journal that publishes your article online once you submit it, and then publishes the peer-reviews and iterations of the paper.

From my (Greg's) perspective, where you publish a pre-print isn't all that important, though more popular pre-print servers can presumably help with visibility of your work.
The most important thing is that you're getting a DOI that you can use to reference your article, and ideally that you can update the pre-print when you update the manuscript.
Just confirm that your target journal for the peer-reviewed version of your publication doesn't restrict you from sharing the article on pre-print servers.
Most don't, but if it doubt it doesn't hurt to check.
