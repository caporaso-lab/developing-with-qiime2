# Publicize your QIIME 2 tools

If you want others to use your QIIME 2 tools, you have to market them.
Ultimately that's your responsibility - **you** built it, **you** know it, **you're** proud of it, so **you need to promote it**.

Here are some ideas on how to market your tools so that others will discover and use them.
If you have suggestions on additional ways to publicize QIIME 2 plugins or other tools, we're interested!
Please [feel free to reach out](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/developing-with-qiime2/issues).

## Help others understand how your tool will help them

Everyone is busy.
While a lot of us would love to spend time experimenting with cool things people are making, ultimately we don't have time and we tend to only invest time in discovering and learning the things that are *very obviously going to advance our priorities*.
When you're marketing your tool to someone, start by making it clear how it can advance their priorities.
This is primarily about them and their goals - not you and your goals.
You're selling, and you're hoping they're buying.

Ideally, show them - don't tell them - how your tool will advance their priorities.
For example, reach out and ask people if you can run your software on their data to generate some new insights.
If they're interested, get on the same page regarding publication expectations - is this something you could publish on now, or could you co-author work that they're preparing?
Then do it, and help them honestly interpret the results.
If your tool doesn't show anything new, don't try to oversell it or they won't trust you next time.
Regardless of how it works, learn from the process and use it to improve your tool and your approach.
As your tool helps others with their work, their [word-of-mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-of-mouth_marketing) and their publications will market your work.

## QIIME 2 Library
We are currently (23 April 2024) working on a simplified set of tools for sharing your plugins with the QIIME 2 community, and this will ultimately replace the [QIIME 2 Library](https://library.qiime2.org).
Our end goal is to help you provide users with information such as the compatibility of your plugins with the current {term}`distributions <Distribution>`, where to find documentation and technical support, how to cite your plugin, and more.
We expect incremental progress on this over the next year.

## Community Contributions on the QIIME 2 Forum

When you create a new QIIME 2-based tool and are ready to share it with the QIIME 2 community, we recommend posting a new topic in the [Community Contributions category on the QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/community-contributions/15).
This is a way to share information on your tool, including what it is and how people can start using it.
For example, you could include information on the project's website, a brief tutorial, and how users should request technical support.

## Post a pre-print

Pre-prints are a citable way to get software announcement articles out while peer review is in process.
As you probably know, peer review can take *ages* and software moves quickly, so we find that it's worth it to publish software announcement pre-prints.
However, software annoucement papers are unfortunately not accepted by many pre-print servers.
Here are some exceptions to that, based on our experiences.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a pre-print server that does [seem to](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11198) accept software announcement pre-prints (e.g, see their [Quantitiative Biology](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio) category).

F1000 is another option that [we've had luck with](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-657).
It's not technically a pre-print server, but a peer-review journal that publishes your article online once you submit it, and then publishes the peer-reviews and iterations of the paper.

From my (Greg's) perspective, where you publish a pre-print isn't all that important, though more popular pre-print servers can presumably help with visibility of your work.
The most important thing is that you're getting a DOI that you can use to reference your article, and ideally that you can update the pre-print when you update the manuscript.
Just confirm that your target journal for the peer-reviewed version of your publication doesn't restrict you from sharing the article on pre-print servers.
Most don't, but if it doubt it doesn't hurt to check.
